# what is RGB color system
The RGB color system is a color coding, a way to express a color using a combination of the three primary colors Red-Green-Blue, based on additive color mixing. The amount of each primary color required to obtain the mixed color is expressed in a number that usually consists of 8 bits and can vary between 0 and 255. 

# How it works
The game works in such a way that there are a number of squires with a visible color and at the top off this colors there is a RGB color system in the form of a number such as RGB (234.34.34) which must measure with a particular squire that haves the same visible color like the number of the RG color system.
